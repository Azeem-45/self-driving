# self-driving
An autonomous driving project using deep learning with Python.
A CNN model is trained on simulator images to predict steering angles, and drive.py uses the trained model to control the car automatically on the track.

This project is part of the Udacity Self-Driving Car course. It uses deep learning to teach a car how to drive itself in a simulator. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on images collected from the carâ€™s cameras to predict the right steering angle. The trained model is then used in the drive.py file to control the car automatically inside the simulator, keeping it on the track without human input
